Full Stack Project to store dreamsðŸ§¡. You will just need to place your Firebase "serviceAccountKey.json" file in the root folder of the backend and that's it ^^, it will be working. And of course, don't forget to give these two commands in both terminals: "npm i" and "npm run dev" respectively. See it on [Vercel](https://tell-me-your-dreams.vercel.app/).
